<p class="justify">The <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/my-year-in-temperatures--scarf-">Temperature Scarf</a> project (also known as <em>My Year In Temperatures</em>) is a knitting aid designed to help users create a scarf from the knitting / crocheting site <a href="http://www.ravelry.com">Ravelry</a>. First posted by Kristen Cooper, the idea is to use local daily average temperatures as a color key, producing a scarf that reads like a daily temperature record of your hometown.</p>
<p class="justify">I saw the opportunity to create a project that could automatically display the correct temperatures and colors for each day. With this functionality, the user no longer has to manually look up temperatures and find the correct color by hand.</p>

<p class="text-center muted" style="line-height: 15px; font-size: 11px;">A simple color configuration.</p>
<p class="justify">After picking colors and assigning names for easy identification, users can generate a scarf pattern using automatically updated data for his or her hometown. Progress is tracked with a simple click or tap, and is remembered between sessions. Updated data from <a href="http://academic.udayton.edu/kissock/http/Weather/citylistUS.htm">Dayton University</a> is added to the pattern as soon as it is available, and the chosen colors and temperatures can be reconfigured at any time.</p>
